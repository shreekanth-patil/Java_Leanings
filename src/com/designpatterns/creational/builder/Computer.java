 * 
 *  Factory pattern problem
 * 
 *         There are three major issues with Factory and Abstract Factory design
 *         patterns when the Object contains a lot of attributes.
 * 
 *         1. Too Many arguments to pass from client program to the Factory
 *         class that can be error prone because most of the time, the type of
 *         arguments are same and from client side its hard to maintain the
 *         order of the argument.
 * 
 *         2. Some of the parameters might be optional but in Factory pattern,
 *         we are forced to send all the parameters and optional parameters need
 *         to send as NULL.
 * 
 *         3. If the object is heavy and its creation is complex, then all that
 *         complexity will be part of Factory classes that is confusing.
 * 
 *         Solution : Builder Pattern We can solve the issues with large number
 *         of parameters by providing a constructor with required parameters and
 *         then different setter methods to set the optional parameters but the
 *         problem with this is that the Object state will be inconsistent until
 *         unless all the attributes are set explicitly.
 * 
 *         Builder pattern solves the issue with large number of optional
 *         parameters and inconsistent state by providing a way to build the
 *         object step-by-step and provide a method that will actually return
 *         the final Object.
 * 
 * 
 * Builder Pattern Implementation
 * 
 *         1. First of all you need to create a static nested class and then
 *         copy all the arguments from the outer class to the Builder class. We
 *         should follow the naming convention and if the class name is Computer
 *         then builder class should be named as ComputerBuilder.
 * 
 *         2. The Builder class should have a public constructor with all the
 *         required attributes as parameters.
 * 
 *         3. Builder class should have methods to set the optional parameters
 *         and it should return the same Builder object after setting the
 *         optional attribute.
 * 
 *         4. The final step is to provide a build() method in the builder class
 *         that will return the Object needed by client program. For this we
 *         need to have a private constructor in the Class with Builder class as
 *         argument.
