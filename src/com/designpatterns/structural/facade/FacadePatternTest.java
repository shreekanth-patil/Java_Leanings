/**

 * 
 *         Facade Pattern is one of the Structural design patterns (such as
 *         Adapter pattern and Decorator pattern) and used to help client
 *         applications to easily interact with the system.
 * 
 *         Suppose we have an application with set of interfaces to use
 *         MySql/Oracle database and to generate different types of reports,
 *         such as HTML report, PDF report etc. So we will have different set of
 *         interfaces to work with different types of database. Now a client
 *         application can use these interfaces to get the required database
 *         connection and generate reports. But when the complexity increases or
 *         the interface behavior names are confusing, client application will
 *         find it difficult to manage it. So we can apply Facade pattern here
 *         and provide a wrapper interface on top of the existing interface to
 *         help client application.
